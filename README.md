# Plant Disease Diagnosis System

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive plant disease diagnosis system designed to identify plant diseases based on signs and symptoms. The system leverages a neural network model (Memory Network) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras, integrated with a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input symptoms and receive predictions.

## Features

- **Flask Web Application**: A RESTful API for users to submit symptoms and receive disease predictions.
- **Memory Network Model**: A custom NLP model that utilizes LSTM layers to process and classify plant disease data.
- **PlantVillage Dataset**: The model is trained on a dataset containing various plant diseases along with their associated signs and symptoms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Plant-Disease-Diagnosis
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

### Starting the Flask Application

To start the Flask web application, run the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the specified port).

## API Endpoints

- POST /predict 
    - Description: Predicts plant disease based on symptoms. 
    - Request Body:
      ```json
        {
          "symptoms": ["symptom1", "symptom2", ...]
        }
      ```
    - Response:
        ```json
        {
          "predictions": [
            {"disease": "Disease Name", "confidence": 0.85},
            {"disease": "Disease Name", "confidence": 0.10},
            ...
          ]
        }
        ```
## Training the Model

If you need to retrain the model, you can use the MemoryNetWork class in MemoryNetWork.py. Make sure to call the following methods:

1. prepare_data(): Prepares the data for training.
2. split_data(): Splits the data into training and testing sets.
3. build_model(): Builds the neural network model.
4. compile_model(): Compiles the model with the desired loss function and optimizer. 
5. train_model(): Trains the model on the prepared data.    

## Model Predictions

Use the predict_disease() method from the MemoryNetWork class to make predictions based on an array of symptoms:
```python
predictions = network.predict_disease(["symptom1", "symptom2"])
```
